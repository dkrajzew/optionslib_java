# Eclipse import

Install m2e plugin for eclipse.

Be sure that you have installed git and download the source code using 

```git clone https://github.com/dkrajzew/optionslib_java.git```

on the command line in a folder of your choice. The name of the folder will be later the name of your project within Eclipse.

Open Eclipse and use File->import. Click on Maven-> existing Maven Projects -> next. The root directory on the next page should be your cloned folder. Select the pom.xml under projects and click on finish.

Now you should have an eclipse Maven project where you can run and debug the java code.
